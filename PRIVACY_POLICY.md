# Privacy Policy for Bookmark XP Explorer

**Last Updated:** December 2024

## Overview

Bookmark XP Explorer is a Chrome extension that provides a Windows XP Explorer-style interface for managing your browser bookmarks. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.**

Bookmark XP Explorer:
- Does NOT collect personal information
- Does NOT track your browsing activity
- Does NOT send any data to external servers
- Does NOT use analytics or tracking services
- Does NOT store any data outside your browser

## Data Storage

All data used by this extension is stored locally in your browser:
- **Bookmarks:** Managed through Chrome's built-in bookmark system
- **Preferences:** View mode and UI settings are stored using Chrome's local storage API

This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third party.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `bookmarks` | Read and modify your bookmarks (core functionality) |
| `storage` | Save your preferences locally (view mode, expanded folders) |
| `tabs` | Open bookmarks in new tabs when you click them |

These permissions are used solely for the extension's functionality and not for data collection.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not use any third-party services, APIs, or analytics tools.

The only external resource used is Google's favicon service (`https://www.google.com/s2/favicons`) to display website icons for your bookmarks. This is a standard Chrome feature and does not involve sharing your personal data.
